# Template Designer

A web-based platform for researchers to collaboratively define and structure their experimental data around a [common data model](https://github.com/enanomapper/nmdataparser/wiki/eNanoMapper-Data-Model). Formerly known as “templateforge”.

Template Designer guides researchers through the structured definition of experimental templates aligned with the data model. Users are prompted to describe the method, define experimental factors, and specify results as raw or processed data, all mapped to expected data model entities. Method parameters (e.g. mechanistic annotation, cell line, instrument settings), sample details, and provenance metadata are collected in dedicated steps.

The tool distinguishes between variable factors, fixed parameters, and provenance metadata. Role-aware template authoring supports quality control and reuse.

Template Designer focuses on defining the structure of the experiment without prescribing the layout. It creates template blueprints, where each blueprint has a corresponding option to generate and download an Excel template. The layout is produced dynamically, with the original blueprint embedded. This embedded metadata enables the file to be interpreted unambiguously and converted into machine-readable formats.
